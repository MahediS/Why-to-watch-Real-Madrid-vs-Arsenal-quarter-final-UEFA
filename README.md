A Tactical Viewpoint
Real Madrid could press 4-2-4 and open by beating up Arsenal’s flanks. Mbappé and Vinícius will hunt for the rare counterattack, while Valverde and Modric will battle for midfield control. Combat will be high-stakes and punchy.
Arsenal, though, find themselves absorbing plenty of pressure and teetering on the edge of possession, and both Saka and Martinelli have inclinations to thrive on the counter. Set pieces remain a weapon, with rice and parley placed for attack.

It’s not over until your sound ends because we know what kind of late-game sorcery Real Madrid can cook up at the Bernabéu. Theory says that which team should win? Arsenal.
There is at least some consolation for them returning to the Bernabéu in such a rematch, with a glamour tie at Gunners headquarters, where they will at least enjoy the comforts of their own home, and a 3-0 aggregate play-off advantage. Because most of Real Madrid's players pretty much failed to qualify, it's going to be a monumental effort from the team to get to the Final Four. Now, Arsenal, who remain unbeaten, and unbroken in Europe have the chance to reverse into the much more exotic Champions League
