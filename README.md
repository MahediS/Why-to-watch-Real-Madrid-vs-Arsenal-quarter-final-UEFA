A Tactical Viewpoint
Real Madrid could press 4-2-4 and open by beatingâ€‚up Arsenalâ€™s flanks. MbappÃ© andâ€‚VinÃ­cius will hunt for the rare counterattack, while Valverde and Modric will battle for midfield control. Combat will beâ€‚high-stakes and punchy.
Arsenal, though, find themselves absorbing plenty of pressure and teetering on the edge of possession,â€‚and both Saka and Martinelli have inclinations to thrive on the counter. Set pieces remain a weapon,â€‚with rice and parley placed for attack.

Match Odds: Real Madrid 7/10,â€‚Arsenal 7/2, Draw 3/1
Itâ€™s not over until your sound ends because we know what kind ofâ€‚late-game sorcery Real Madrid can cook up at the BernabÃ©u. Theory says that which teamâ€‚should win? Arsenal.
There is at least some consolation for them returning to the BernabÃ©u in such a rematch, with a glamour tie at Gunners headquarters, where they will at leastâ€‚enjoy the comforts of their own home, and a 3-0 aggregate play-off advantage. Because most ofâ€‚Real Madrid's players pretty much failed to qualify, it's going to be a monumental effort from the team to get to the Final Four. Now, Arsenal, who remain unbeaten, and unbrokenâ€‚in Europe have the chance to reverse into the much more exotic Champions League
